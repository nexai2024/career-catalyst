      "The correct answer is B because the area of a circle is equal to πr^2, where r is the radius of the circle. This can be calculated by dividing the circumference of the circle by 2π.",
      "To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the volume of a cylinder, which is V = πr^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. By substituting the given values, we can find the correct answer.",
      "The correct answer is A because the sine of an angle is equal to the opposite side over the hypotenuse in a right triangle. In this case, the opposite side is 3 and the hypotenuse is 5, so the sine of the angle is equal to 3/5.",
      "The correct answer is D because the derivative of the function f(x) = 3x^2 + 2x - 5 is f'(x) = 6x + 2. To find the derivative, we need to apply the power rule and the sum rule.",
      "To solve this problem, we need to use the Pythagorean theorem, which states that the square of the hypotenuse of a right triangle is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. By applying this theorem, we can find the correct answer.",
      "The correct answer is C because the equation 2x + 5 = 11 represents a linear equation in one variable. To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation.",
      "The correct answer is B because the area of a rectangle is equal to the product of its length and width. In this case, the length is 4 and the width is 5, so the area is equal to 20.",
      "To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the area of a triangle, which is A = (b × h) / 2, where b is the base and h is the height. By substituting the given values, we can find the correct answer.",
      "The correct answer is A because the cosine of an angle is equal to the adjacent side over the hypotenuse in a right triangle. In this case, the adjacent side is 4 and the hypotenuse is 5, so the cosine of the angle is equal to 4/5.",
      "The correct answer is D because the equation x^2 + 4x + 4 = 0 represents a quadratic equation. To solve for x, we need to factor the equation or use the quadratic formula.",
      "To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where l is the length and w is the width. By substituting the given values, we can find the correct answer.",
      "The correct answer is B because the equation y = 2x + 3 represents a linear equation in two variables. To find the value of y, we need to substitute the given value of x into the equation.",
      "The correct answer is C because the equation x - 3 = 5 represents a linear equation in one variable. To solve for x, we need to isolate x on one side of the equation.",
      "The correct answer is A because the sine of an angle is equal to the opposite side over the hypotenuse in a right triangle. In this case, the opposite side is 4 and the hypotenuse is 5, so the sine of the angle is equal to 4/5.",
